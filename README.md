# mt122_unity_conversion


## Info
Based upon a [MT122](https://www.speakerplans.com/index.php?id=mt122) open source design from Rog Mogale from speakerplans.com.

12" section will be removed and used for mids (1 per cab).
2" section will be replaced by a mid-top unity/synerge style horn utilising 1x B&C DE250 and 2x B&C 4NDF34.

Coverage angle will be 60x40.

## Design goals

Ideally the 4NDF34 covers 600/700 up to 1.5k-3.5k, DE250 to cover above.

Max width of the outside to match the MT122 (567mm) and the outside to have the same 10 degree angle or less. 

## Construction 

I have a Voron 2.4 with a max build size of 350L x 350W x 300H, ideally final construction is 3D printed for horn/waveguide on a plywood box, if required a 3d printed mould for the horn/waveguide then fibreglass/composite construction can be done.
